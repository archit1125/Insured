a demo of our application and other important details about our application including a ppt file describing different aspects of our application.


Download instruction-
The file Insured.apk can be opened in an android smart phone allowing you to download our application on your smartphone.

Working Details-
The app would work perfectly for any report in the format as uploaded by us, as visible in our demo. For depiction purposes the parameters included are currently limited but the app can be easily expanded to deal with other parameters. We could als expand the app to deal with reports of other formats.
The orthanc website depicted in our demo is currently on a local server and would be visible on any device on the same network as our server.
